# Free Class Limits
A SourceMod script for TF2 servers that allows setting class limits without tournament mode being enabled (while showing class limits in the class select UI).

Uses the vanilla `tf_tournament_classlimit_[classname] [limit]` cvars to control class limits. (-1 meaning no limit)

To install, download the latest zip file from the releases page, and extract it into your `tf/addons/sourcemod/` folder.
