# free-class-limits
A SourceMod script for TF2 servers that allows setting class limits without tournament mode being enabled.

Uses the vanilla `tf_tournament_classlimit_[classname]` cvars to control class limits. (-1 meaning no limit)

Does not need `mp_tournament 1`!
It even shows the class limits in the class select UI.

To install, download the latest zip file from the releases page, and extract it into your `tf/addons/sourcemod/` folder.
